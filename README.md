# Gemini Invoice Extractor

Gemini Invoice Extractor is a Streamlit web application that uses the Gemini Pro Vision model to analyze and extract information from invoice images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Google Generative AI](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/)
- [Pillow (PIL)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gemini-invoice-extractor.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd gemini-invoice-extractor
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file and adding your Google API key:

   ```dotenv
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## How it Works

The application allows you to provide an input prompt and upload an invoice image. Clicking the "Tell me about the image" button triggers the Gemini Pro Vision model to analyze the image and generate a response based on the input prompt.
